Stretch

Pick a different programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Javaâ€¦) and write tests & implementations for each.

 Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
 For each algorithm identified above, there is a test file with multiple unit tests for each algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
 For each algorithm identified above, there is an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.

## Sorting and Searching

#### binarySearch

Search for a number within an array using the **binary search** algorithm.
**[Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)** looks for an item in a list by looking at a list's center, then looking at the center of the left or right half, continually dividing the search space in half until it finds what it's looking for.

```javascript
const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
binarySearch(numbers, 45)
// => 8
```

#### bubbleSort

Sort an array of numbers using the **[bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)** algorithm.

```javascript
bubbleSort([10, 2, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 1, 4, 9])
// => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

#### mergeSort

Sort an array of numbers using the **[merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)** algorithm.

```javascript
mergeSort([10, 2, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 1, 4, 9])
// => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```


## Graphing and Geometry

#### closestPair

Given a set of points on a 2-dimensional plane, return the pair of points with the least distance between them.

Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem)

```javascript
const points = [
  [2,1],
  [4,0],
  [-1,0],
  [5,3],
  [-2,5],
  [3,-3],
  [-2,0],
  [3,4],
  [5,-4],
  [0,-2]
]
closestPair(points)
// => { pair: [[-1, 0], [-2, 0]], distance: 1 }
```

#### isConnectedGraph

Check if a graph is connected or disconnected. Return `true` or `false`.

A graph is connected when there is a path between every pair of vertices.

Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory))

```javascript
const graphA = {
  'a': ['b', 'c'],
  'b': ['a', 'd'],
  'c': ['a', 'd'],
  'd': ['b', 'c'],
}
isConnectedGraph(graphA)
// => true

const graphB = {
  'a': ['b'],
  'b': ['a'],
  'c': ['d'],
  'd': ['c'],
}
isConnectedGraph(graphB)
// => false
```
